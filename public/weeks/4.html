    <h5>Thoughts on Chapters 1-3 from <i>Patterns in the Stone</i></h5>
    <p>
      For the first chapter, I would like to respond to the section “FREE TO
      WORRY ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE”. This chapter
      resonated with me strongly as someone who loves to tinker with computers
      and has their bachelor’s in computer science. To speak to the “difference
      that makes a difference”, not once in my time in the program did was I
      explained to in even as high-level detail as this chapter of the basic
      principles behind actually implementing Boolean logic. Only recently have
      I started to dabble with electronics (shoutout to
      <a href="https://www.electroboom.com/" target="_blank">ElectroBOOM</a>)
      and so this plain term statement of “AND is two switches in series and OR
      is two switches in parallel” really set pieces in place in my mind. So I
      want to say, if this chapter seemed daunting, truly the author means it
      when he says, “For most purposes, we can forget about technology.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The second chapter is certainly a bit headier than the first. I’m not
      entirely certain of the target audience of the book so far. I feel like
      the author is providing a high-level summary of what I learned in
      undergrad, but some entire courses I took are being summarized in a few
      sentences (looking at you Comparative Languages, Computer Organization,
      and Formal Languages and Automata Theory). That is to say, it feels like I
      am getting refresher, and the book assumes some knowledge going in (this
      is a frequent issue I have noticed with computing and math nuts, they’re
      not always the best explainers first time around). Sure enough the intro
      to chapter 3 confirms my suspicions: “Ultimately all these functions are
      implemented by the Boolean logic blocks and finite-state machines
      described in the previous chapter, but the human computer programmer
      rarely thinks about these elements;”
    </p>
    <p>
      Chapter 3 feels more like a proper introduction. I would like to compare
      the Logo example with some more recent technologies that many kids use
      that would similarly expose them to computing at an early age. When I was
      in middle school, all I ever really wanted to do was to play Minecraft. In
      Minecraft, there are computing primitives through Redstone circuits, these
      are optional, commonplace items throughout the game. I was never
      particularly interested in this aspect of the game, but I had plenty of
      friends who were. People have gone on to do some wildly impressive things
      within the game such as:
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW9N6kGbu2I" target="_blank"
        >“I Made a Working Computer with just Redstone!”</a
      >
      or see mod-packs like

        target="_blank"
        >Industrial Craft</a
      >. A few other examples that come to mind are both Garry’s Mod (see the
      <a

        target="_blank"
        >GMod console</a
      >) and Roblox (see

      >), I sit pretty squarely between these generations hence my main exposure
      being Minecraft.
