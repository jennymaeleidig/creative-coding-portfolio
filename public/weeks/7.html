    <h5>Thoughts on <i>The Interface as Sign and as Aesthetic Event</i></h5>
    <p>
      “Computing relies on two kinds of artifact, hardware and software. We
      adopt the position here that the hardware is given, and software is the
      matter of our discussion.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As described throughout the reading, there is a continuous dialect between
      hardware and software, between the software and its external
      representation, and between said representation and the user. Thus, it is
      through this chain that the user becomes increasingly unaware of
      underlying systems and processes, a technique in software design known as
      abstraction. E.g. You don't need to understand IP Routing in order to send
      an email, nor do you need to know the workings of an Internal Combustion
      Engine to drive a vehicle. In most cases, this separation and reliance on
      the semiotic is the intent as often the goal in design is to create
      systems that afford useability.
    </p>
    <p>
      These gaps between hardware, software, its representamen and interpretant,
      and the system (whole) and its user are only growing larger. Take the
      skeuomorph for example. Many early (now ubiquitous) concepts in computing
      and the user interface were all representations of extant materials: the
      Windows, the Desktop, the Recycle Bin, Files, Folders, E-Mail. The
      intention behind this is to promote ease of use, to provide familiarity in
      an unfamiliar environment. As designs have evolved (often through forced
      iteration), the distance from these sources has only grown. See

      Something that I try to communicate through my work is how retro
      technology puts more emphasis on the hardware to create an experience that
      is much less a representation and more of a connection. I feel there is
      often a tenderness that comes along with this, e.g. the delicateness of
      cassette and VHS tapes. There is also a greater degree of physical and
      sensory activity, with individual dials, tactile buttons, and lights. I
      think how I go about presenting or communicating information in the
      digital age is always going to come back to many of the principles
      discussed within this week's reading,
